        "\n",
        "Anomalies, often referred to as outliers, are data points that significantly differ from the rest of the data. In the realm of Machine Learning (ML), anomaly detection is a critical process, especially in domains like fraud detection, system health monitoring, and intrusion detection. The power of ML in anomaly detection lies in its ability to learn from data and identify patterns that may not be immediately obvious to the human eye.\n",
