        "-   Logistic regression is a type of statistical method used in machine learning for binary classification problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   It's a go-to algorithm when the outcome we want to predict falls into one of two categories, like whether an email is spam or not.\n",

        "-   Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability that an instance belongs to a particular category.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The predicted probability is then transformed using a logistic function, squashing it between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The outcome is classified based on a chosen threshold: if the probability is above the threshold, it's one class; otherwise, it's the other.\n",

        "\n",
        "-   **Probabilistic Prediction:** Logistic regression predicts the likelihood (probability) of an instance belonging to a specific class.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Sigmoid Function:** The logistic or sigmoid function is used to convert raw predictions into probabilities, ensuring they're within the 0 to 1 range.\n",
